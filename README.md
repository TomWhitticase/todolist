# To-do List 📝

Welcome to the To-do List! 🎉 This is a web-based tool for organizing your tasks and to-dos. It was built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and MUI.

To use the To-do List, simply go to the website and start adding your tasks. You can mark tasks as completed and delete them as needed. Additionally, you can enter your email address and the To-do List will send you a copy of your current tasks.

If you have any questions or feedback about the To-do List, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd love to hear from you! 💬

Thank you for checking out my To-do List. I hope it helps you stay organized and on top of your tasks! 🙏
